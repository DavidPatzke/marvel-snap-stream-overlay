# marvel-snap-stream-overlay
Small and simple node script that automatically displays the currently used deck on a web page during gameplay

Simple run the index.js file in the root directory and add a browser source with the url http://localhost:30000/overlay.html.

This is currently a pure self used project so there a no convenience function at all. If you are interesseted in this project feel free to add them and raise a PR.

For example :
* Bundle this to a .exe with an UI
* Make the state-directory from Snap and the used port configurable
